Responsive Protfolio

The Responsive-Portfolio is a website that consists of my protfilio, a brief bio, and a way to get into contact with me.  This project focuses on using Bootstrap in order to achive responsive webpage layouts that are both readible and well organized when viewed using various devices with different screen sizes.

The website consist of three sepertate webpages that can be navigated by use of a navbar at the top of each webpage. 

The first webpage titled "About Me" contains infomation about me. 

The second webpage contains a portfolio that links to other content I have created or websites in which I have a presence (such as LinkedIn).

The third webpage is a form where the user can contact me by leaving their name, e-mail address, and a brief message.
