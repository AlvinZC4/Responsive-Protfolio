            <!-- Information about me -->
            <p>My name is Alvin Cox and I am enrolled in the Bootcamp Coding Course. Currently I work as a Validation
              Engineer for a contracting company. I am a graduate of Randolph-Macon College where I majored in Physics
              and minored in Mathematics and Astrophysics. I also have an Associates Degree in Mechanical Engineering
              Technology. I currently live in Prince George County, VA</p>

            <p>I am happily married and am the father of three girls. I enjoy spending as much time with my family as
              possible. I enjoy being outdoors, especially during warmer weather. Back yard barbaques with family and
              friends, going to the lake or beach are definitely my favorite activities. My wife and I are a couple of
              foodies so we enjoy checking about new and diffenert restruants whenever we can. Usually no matter what I
              am doing as long as I am with my family I am happy.</p>
